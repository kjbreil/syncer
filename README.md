# WARNING
Not in a usable sate. Do not use directly. This is not tested and is stupid complicated in the usage of reflection to accomplish the goals. It is not optimized at all and is in a “it works for me” state.

# Syncer
This is built out of my want to have the same program running on two different systems and kept in sync. It narrowly achieves those goals but is not flexible for generally use.
